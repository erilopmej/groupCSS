            <h2>What is Git?</h2>
            <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapchats (commits) of
              your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth
              of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshots
              you took or merge those experiments into the your app.</p>

            <h2>What is GitHub</h2>
            <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and other work togethr
              on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during developent.

                    <h3> Git init </h3>
                    <p>Git init is te act of 
    registering this current code base. </p>

                    <h3>Git add </h3>
                    <p>Git add is how we stage the integration of our current code base into our current list of snapshots</p>

                  <h3>Git status </h3>

                    <h3>Git commit </h3>
                    <p>Git commit; Finally we can commit those changes we added to our last sanpshots giving us a
                    new snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made.</p>

                  <h3>Git remote add</h3>
                  <p>Git remote add is used to set up a online repository where we can place all of our current code.
                  this is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>

                  <h3>Git push</h3>
                  <p>Git push is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all
                    of our respositories. other developers might look at our existing projects
                    to see how we approached problems, pull down our code base with features they wanted to add.</p>
